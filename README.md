### 1.
Input the geographical coordinates of the left down and right upper corners in the following format: <N/E/W/S> <number>
For example: N 50
  
### 2.
A new color can be added to the palette by inputting numbers into the R/G/B fields. It'll be displayed upon clicking "Sprawdz kolor". If we are satisfied with it, we can add the colour by clicking "Dodaj kolor".
  
### 3.
Next, in the right window, input altitudes which will be represented by the colours of your choice. Choosing number X for a given colour means it'll represent altitudes lower than X meters.
  
### 4.
Choose a name for the image file that'll be created, then click "Start".

### 5.
Once the image is generated, you can also make a scaled down version of it by clicking 
a new button – "Pokaz pomniejszony obraz". It'll have the same name, but with "_scaled" added at the end.

Example usage of the program is shown below – these exact settings can be used to generate a map of Poland.

Files used to create the image should be added to the hgt directory.
If compiled under Linux, needed files will be downloaded automatically.
